# AVR_ILI9341
============
This is an ILI9341 display library for AVR (Mega and Leonardo) arduino boards.
Hardware SPI pins are used here because they are the only way the specified AVR boards can interact with the display

This library relies on the SPI library for communication with the screen and needs to be included in all sketches.
